# Obsidian Heading View Plugin

This is a community plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This project uses TypeScript to provide type checking and documentation.

The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in TypeScript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

This plugin will allow you to view your files in the file explorer according to the first heading, instead of the actual file name. 
It will NOT change the file name or first heading, but only affect the way it is viewed in Obsidian.
It was created to offer the same functionality that Zettlr offers, as I find it exremely helpful to instantly see the content of the file, while maintaining a time stamp file name.
